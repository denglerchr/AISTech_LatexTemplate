# AISTech_LatexTemplate
LaTeX template for the AISTech conference. You can download it as a zip using "Code/Downlaod Zip" on the top right.

Minor inconsistencies with the official Word Template:
- The title is 12pt as recommended in the official Author Guide. The Word template uses 11pt.
- References are formatted according to *plainnat* which uses e.g. "pages" instead of "pp". It should nevertheless fulfill all requirements of the conference.
